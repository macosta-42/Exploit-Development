# Description:

A basic nmap scan script

I have created this script as I was preparing for my eJPT exam.

- Run 4 different scans

Very fast basic scan:
```
sudo nmap --min-rate 500 -T4 -F -oX nmap/initial [IP] --open -v
```
Fullport scan:
```
sudo nmap --min-rate 500 -T4 -sC -sV -O -p- -oX nmap/fullscan [IP]
```
Vulnerability scan:
```
sudo nmap -Pn --script vuln -sV -p [PORTS] -oX nmap/vuln [IP]
```
UDP scan:
```
sudo nmap --min-rate 500 -sU -O -T4 -p- -oX nmap/udp [IP]
```

- Convert xml scan report in html

- Run a Python3 HTTP server on port 9999

- Launch Firefox on localhost:9999
